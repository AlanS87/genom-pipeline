# GenOM Pipeline

This repository contains an implementation of the ontology alignment approach
described in the paper:

> **GenOM: Ontology Matching with Description Generation and Large Language Models**, under review.

The codebase is currently under active development. At the time of submission,
the repository serves as a placeholder for the upcoming public release of the
full pipeline, including automated execution scripts and usage documentation.

The implementation will be progressively updated.
